## Features

### Initiative-Driven Workflow
- **Propose initiatives** with severity levels (LOW/MED/HIGH)
- **Automatic triage** — LOW/MED auto-proceed, HIGH requires CEO approval
- **Status tracking** — Draft -> Proposed -> Approved -> Active -> Completed
- **Markdown files** — Initiatives and decisions are stored as markdown files in `.octopod/initiatives/` and `.octopod/decisions/`

### Hermes Agent Integration
Octopod uses [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) as the AI agent backend. Hermes is a self-improving AI agent built by Nous Research with support for 200+ models via OpenRouter.

Press `a` in the Planning tab to open an interactive tmux chat with Hermes about an initiative. Hermes can suggest improvements and, upon your approval, apply changes to the markdown file.

### Autonomous AI Agents
- Each department runs its own **always-on agent daemon** powered by Hermes
- Agents **pick up unassigned tasks** automatically
- Agents **collaborate via message bus**

### CEO Dashboard
- **Decision Queue** — see all HIGH-severity decisions awaiting your approval
- **Severity indicators** — HIGH / MED / LOW
- **Initiative Planning** — track all company initiatives

### Department TUIs
Each department has its own terminal interface with:
- **Board view** — Kanban-style task board
- **List view** — filterable task list
- **Activity feed** — real-time department activity
- **Chat** — inter-department communication

### Activity Log
- All agent actions logged to database
- CEO can view all activity across departments
- Timestamps, actors, actions tracked

## Severity System

Agents interpret severity themselves — no keyword matching:

| Severity | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| 🔴 HIGH | CEO approval required via decision queue |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Auto-proceed, log only |
| ⚪ LOW | Auto-proceed, log only |
